  <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
  <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We use CSS to apply style and formatting to websites. It's a best practice as a programmer to keep <em>content</em> and <em>styling</em> separate. That way we can keep our files simple and also allow for different webpages to have the same styling! Imagine if every time the New York Times had to publish an article they had to re-do the look of the entire newspaper!</p>

  <h3>What Can I change Using CSS?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Font type</li>
    <li>Text sizes</li>
    <li>Backgrounds</li>
    <li>Borders</li>
    <li>Page Layout</li>
    <li>Margins</li>
    <li>Image sizes</li>
    <li>Rounding edges</li>
    <li>LOTS MORE...</li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Tell me about CSS Syntax... </h3>
  <p> CSS syntax is pretty straightforward. The selector chooses the element whose formatting you want to change. The declaration explains how to change the element</p>

  <h3>How do we get CSS to affect HTML</h3>
    <p> You need to create a CSS stylesheet and link to it in your HTML file. Your link should be in the 'head' section of the html and should look something like this:<br>
     &#60link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="path_to_stylesheet"&#62

  <h3>What are these things we call classes and ids?</h3>
  <p id="about-classes-and-ids">Sometimes we have to get more granular than what the tags in our html can provide us. For example, we only want to convert one of our h3 headings to a different color. If we change the css of h3s, the will all change. So we add classes and/or ids. Classes and ids are 'markers' that we put in our HTML so that we can reference them in our CSS stylesheets. An id can only be used once in a page, but a class can be used multiple times. In our stylesheets, ids are referenced with a '#' and classes are referenced with a '.'.

  <h3>OK, I get it. Stop blabbering and let's practice!</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Change the size of the h1 header to 40px</li>
      <li>Change the color of the h1 header to 'blue'</li>
      <li>Change all h2 headers to 25px, Arial font, color: #800000
</li>
      <li>Change the background color of the page to #FFFFCC
</li>
      <li>Give all the images on the page a green border, using a hex color. Center it on the page.</li>
      <li>All horizontal rules should be 5px high and 60% of the screen wide. Make them purple using the background-color property. Get rid of the border using 'border-style'</li>
      <li>Change the font of the <em>first paragraph</em> to 'Shadows Into Light' from <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a></li>
      <li>Make the baby meme image have a max-width of 30% of the screen</li>
    </ul>
